## Clustering of uncharacterised data
The dataset clustered into active and inactive against protein targets under study by applying unsupervised machine learning taking atom pair (AP), fingerprints (FP), and similarity indices (SI) into account. 

## Pre-requisites 
ChemmineR 
RDkit  packages in R

## Procedure
Select refernce molecules; any standard drug
calculate AP and FP and SI
Apply the Program
Label teh clustered data
